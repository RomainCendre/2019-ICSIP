% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.

% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in

\begin{abstract}
    Reflectance Confocal Microscopy is an imaging modality more and more used for diagnosis of skin pathologies in clinical context thanks to specific and rich information they provide. However, few studies applied automatic methods for prediction in this kind of images. Therefore, we investigate in this paper a classification on these images on three categories: Healthy, Benign and Malignant Lentigo. To this end, we implement three feature extraction ways, namely Wavelets, Haralick and CNN through Transfer Learning. Furthermore, we exploit these feature extraction within two approaches: the first one operates on the entire image and the second one operates at patch-level (many patches in an image) by giving a score for each patch. The scores are merged later to build a final decision for an image. Results show that Transfer learning obtain the best results for the two approaches and particularly with Average pooling.
