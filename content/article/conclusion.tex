\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{conclusion}
In this study, we proposed and evaluated two processing pipelines on \ac{rcm} images for evaluation of Lentigo. These two pipelines exploit in two different ways three approaches for feature extraction, namely Wavelets, Haralick and CNN via Transfer learning. In the first pipeline we operate training and prediction on the whole image wile in the second pipeline a patch-based training and prediction is achieved. The final decision for an image is made by merging the different scores obtained at patch levels. Further research will investigate fine-tuning of last layers as it should give some improvements in this way.\par
Further improvements will consider other ways of merging decisions or score based on existing works to improve existing method.\par
