\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{conclusion}
In this study, we proposed and evaluated two processing pipelines on \ac{rcm} images for evaluation of Lentigo. These two pipelines compare three approaches for feature extraction, namely Wavelets, Haralick and CNN via Transfer learning. In the first pipeline we operate training and prediction on the whole image while in the second pipeline, we use patch-based training to achieve prediction. The final decision for an image is made by merging the different scores obtained at patch levels. For further research, we aim to investigate the improvements obtained by fine-tuning of the last layers.\par
Next improvements will consider novels methods to merge decisions or scores based on existing works.\par
